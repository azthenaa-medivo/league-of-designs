    <h3>What's League of Designs about ?</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Artemys, and I'm fascinated by League of Legends' (or rather, Riot's) take on design and balance.
        Because a lot of answers to our
        everyday questions (such as why Irelia hasn't been reworked in years) can be found on the
        <a href="http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/">Official Boards</a>, I built this hub that gathers
        those <span class="ressource-Health">Red Posts</span> for you to read more easily. Have a good day !
        (That was a tl;dr.)
    </p>
    <h3>What can we expect from League of Designs ?</h3>
    <p>
        A very convenient way to browse Red Posts. For starters :
        <ul>
            <li>A hopefully comprehensive list of all <a href="{% url "red-posts" %}">Red Posts</a> from
            <a href="http://forums.na.leagueoflegends.com/board/">Riot's Boards</a>. It's a bit like The Red Tracker
            you find on various websites (<a href="http://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/redtracker">and the official
            one</a>), with the added benefit of being sorted by champions. So you can check what CertainlyT is
            secretly planning for <a href="{% url "champion" url_id="Teemo" %}">Teemo</a>. (That's a totally
            innocent example.)</li>
            <li>The goal is to help understand Riot's stances on champion design. League of Legends is only
            at the dawn of its potential awesomefulness (!!), it's a great time to learn why Irelia will be
            reworked and why you can't just nerf/buff stuff and get away with it. (Another utterly unbiased
            example.)</li>
            <li>EASTER EGGS</li>
            <li>In the future, I hope to add a section about items. They're equally important to the game, and
            we are only starting to see more good iterations of them. I haven't studied the matter as much
            as I have done with Champions though.</li>
            <li><strike>Broken CSS</strike> sshhhhhh</li>
            <li>I will probably use this website as a blog - them Articles -, but if you want to contribute,
            you can send me a mail at <b>azthenaa (dot) medivo (at) gmail (dot) com</b>.</li>
